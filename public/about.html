<h1>More about Me</h1>
<p>I am born and raised in China. 
  My home town is in the province of Inner Mongolia.
  When I was a child, I live in a city surranded by forest. 
  It is with very nice nature. 
  During spring and fall, 
  the school normally arrange us to take to group trip in the forest 
  where there is also spring. 
  The warter from the sprin is very clean and tatse super good.

  When I was a teenager, my family moved to another city in the middle of our province.
  It is also where my parents grow up. The city is surranded by big grassland.
  It is also near the hometown of the a famous Queen of China "Xiao Zhuang". 
  She accompanied and supported 3 Kings to build a great Empaire, her husband, son and grandson. 
  Especially, she helped her son to manage the country, since he was only 8 when he become the king.
